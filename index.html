      <p>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> During the process of unification with the
        national organization, MKPUSA explicitly represented that the NWTA
        would remain under the control of local area(s). At the onset of the
        Covid-19 pandemic (and with presumed good intentions), MKPUSA departed
        from its agreement and disallowed NWTAs nationwide. Two years later,
        men who wish to be vaccinated have been; others understand the risks
        of gathering. For all of the following reasons (see below), it is now
        time for MKPUSA to facilitate men's work by honoring its stated
        agreement, returning the NWTA to local control and allowing men and
        constituent areas to take responsibility for themselves.
      </p>

      <p class="center">
        Speak your truth!<br />
        The world is on fire.<br />
        Take responsibility for yourself.<br />
        Be accountable and keep your agreements.<br />
        What’s at risk? No withholds.<br />
        Ask for what you need.<br />
        “Never doubt that a thoughtful group of committed citizens can change
        the world, for indeed it is the only thing that ever has.”<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ve been around men’s work as represented by the ManKind Project
        (MKP), you may recognize these sayings as foundational to who we are
        and what we do.
      </p>

      <p>Consider one more:</p>

      <p>
        “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to
        do nothing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Regarding the NWTA, and in response to Covid (and even with the best
        of intentions), MKPUSA has arrived at the functional outcome of doing
        nothing.<a id="f1-inline" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is your
        invitation to consider the impact of the current course and what <em>you</em>
        can do to make a difference. If you care about preserving/​reclaiming
        the power of the NWTA in a post Covid world, settle in for a detailed
        discussion.
      </p>

      <p>Two data points inform this effort:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          By October 2021, large scale events had begun to return to the
          Intermountain area, and I attended a concert in a packed arena. The
          organizers did it right: proof of vaccination or a negative Covid
          test was required. Because of these requirements, the concert
          started nearly an hour later than stated, but ticket holders
          willingly complied with guidelines set forth by local health
          officials.
        </li>
        <li>
          One month earlier, Intermountain’s NWTA had been cancelled by MKPUSA
          in response to “rising infection rates,” even though we had proposed
          and were planning an NWTA for which vaccinations and other safety
          measures would be required for all in attendance.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Intermountain had done its homework. An internal survey suggested that
        greater than 90% of Intermountain men were in favor of a vaccinated
        weekend. Four medical experts had signed a statement in favor of our
        plan. Our stated intention for a vaccinated weekend was <em>not</em> about
        excluding anyone from attending, but to do <em>something</em> safely. In our
        calculations, an imperfect (but safe) NWTA was better than not holding
        one at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        MKPUSA acknowledged receipt of our proposal but never provided a
        formal reply. In light of this omission, I and several others asked
        for a Zoom call with an MKPUSA administrator. That call took place on
        August 17, 2021.
      </p>

      <p>
        The discussion was a rousing one. Among several topics discussed was
        one statement that stood out in particular. After discussing the topic
        of risk with regard to the NWTA, the administrator became tearful and
        said, “I am not going to have anyone die on my watch.”
      </p>

      <p>
        My first reaction, then and now, was to honor this man for what I
        judge(d) to be unstinting loyalty to men’s work in general and to the
        ManKind Project in particular. I have never questioned this man’s
        motives.
      </p>

      <p>
        My second thought was that this man needed support from many others so
        that the weight of decision making for MKPUSA and for the NWTA didn’t
        land primarily on him, as it seemed (from his comment) to have done.
      </p>
      <p>
        My third thought was to reflect that emergencies don’t necessarily
        alter agreements. With due respect for the motives of MKPUSA (as
        represented by this administrator), the language under which
        unification<a id="f2-inline" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> was pitched
        to MKP Intermountain was clear and unambiguous. Unification was
        represented primarily as an administrative streamlining. Upon
        unification, decision making for the NWTA was to remain with each
        local area. From the “Unification Overview” document circulated <em>prior</em>
        to the vote to unify:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Unification will provide our center with an improved business
          structure including written guidelines, procedures, roles and
          responsibilities that will assist us in maintaining solvency and
          health in perpetuity. To most men in our center, not much will
          change or look different.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Under the heading, “What will not change” we read:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Our Intermountain name, culture, and identity</li>
          <li class="plain">…</li>
          <li>
            Our [Intermountain’s] ability to decide
            <em>when and where we hold NWTAs</em> and other MKP related
            trainings (emphasis added)
          </li>
          <li>
            Our ability to hold winter retreats, summer gatherings, work
            weekends, and other local or area-wide non-MKP governed community
            gatherings and events<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Every NWTA I’ve staffed has clearly differentiated between integrity
        (acting in accordance with our values) and accountability (acting in
        accordance with our <em>agreements</em>). Thus even with the best of
        intentions, MKPUSA can still be out of <em>accountability</em> with specific
        representations and agreements that have been based on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the ManKind Project, we often teach that to violate agreements is
        to act out of shadow. We have a defined accountability process by
        which to identify our shadow(s), acknowledge the impacts of our
        decisions, and reclaim our power as men in right relationship with
        others.
      </p>

      <h2>The Data</h2>

      <p>
        “The world is on fire.” This is nowhere more evident than by the
        divided approach taken to the Covid pandemic. In some states, masks
        and vaccines have been mandated. In other states, legislatures have
        enacted broad protections for organizations, shielding them from
        liability for Covid exposure, except in cases of “gross negligence,
        willful misconduct, or failure to follow public health orders…” See
        <a
          href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/covid-19-shield-laws-proliferate-even-as-liability-suits-do-not">“Covid-19
          Shield Laws Proliferate Even as Liability Suits Do
          Not.”</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        It is likely that any reasonable party can appreciate emergency
        measures instituted at the beginning of a pandemic. Now, two years
        later, MKPUSA’s one-size-fits-all policy not only violates its written
        representations, it makes no allowance for different communities with
        different sentiments, different laws, different risk profiles, and
        different cultures. Failure to honor local control of the NWTA is
        having an escalating impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s At Risk?” Every statement I’ve heard regarding MKPUSA’s Covid
        response has focused on risk to the national organization. The
        foregone conclusion seems to be that the legal risk of an NWTA
        outweighs the potential benefits. Research by the Pew Charitable
        Trusts, one of our nation’s oldest and most respected nonprofit
        organizations, presents a different view in the article,
        <a
          href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/07/21/states-braced-for-a-wave-of-covid-lawsuits-it-never-arrived">“States
          Braced for a Wave of COVID Lawsuits. It Never Arrived.”</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Why did the expected wave of lawsuits never arrive? The article
        explains that, “because of the nature of COVID-19, including how fast
        and easily it spreads, pinpointing and proving the exact location
        where someone got the virus is difficult.” In order to be successful,
        any litigation would have to do just that.
      </p>

      <h2>The Impact</h2>

      <p>
        For argument’s sake, we will still assume that with respect to Covid,
        the legal risk of an NWTA is not zero. Here we draw on an NWTA
        protocol for assistance. Every “What’s At Risk” process on the NWTA
        consists of two forks in the decision tree. Each man is asked to weigh
        the risk of moving forward to get what he wants <em>against the risk</em> of
        staying where he is at. Two years into a pandemic, we can all
        appreciate some risk. But has MKPUSA properly weighed the risk of
        holding an NWTA <em>against the risk</em> of continuing to functionally forbid
        it? What are some of those risks?
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Suicide. Have you ever heard a man say that the NWTA saved his life?
          I have. I am one of those men. Can we be Covid “safe” by disallowing
          the NWTA and <em>still</em> lose more men than we save?
        </li>
        <li>
          Inertia. Is MKPUSA weighing being completely Covid “safe” (e.g., no
          NWTAs) against the damage done to institutional inertia? The
          relevance of a nonprofit organization can be measured by the current
          impact it has on the life of each participant. Inertia built and
          sustained over many years can be lost comparatively quickly through
          inaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Relevance. I have seen firsthand men lose interest in the ManKind
          Project in favor of organizations that are allowing trainings. Many
          others (including most Intermountain men) have spoken in favor of
          separating from MKPUSA because of the concerns outlined above.
        </li>
        <li>
          Financial Problems. Like any organization, MKPUSA requires money to
          function. By cutting off a primary revenue source in the NWTA,
          MKPUSA has requested emergency donations. The USLB has insisted on
          continued payment of dues during a time when leadership development
          has functionally halted along with the NWTA. These financial
          problems have resulted from a single, inflexible response to the
          pandemic. All around us, the world is moving on, learning to
          function during a pandemic. It’s time for MKPUSA to do so as well.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cultural Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        MKPUSA is currently engaged in the honorable pursuit of becoming more
        conversant with the richness of cultures and cultural differences. As
        important as this work is, cultural diversity must mean more than
        reckoning with the crimes of a dominant culture. At its widest
        application, diversity reckons not only with misdeeds (or shadow), but
        also honors the brilliance (or gold) each culture brings to the table.
        American/Western culture has traditionally celebrated participatory
        government and representation. MKPUSA has closed working groups that
        decide matters of policy. By seeking input from the community at
        large, could MKPUSA obviate the need for this very web site? Is MKPUSA
        aware of how many within its ranks feel disenfranchised because they
        have not been accorded a means of voicing their ideas and concerns to
        MKPUSA administration? Would we do justice to “cultural diversity” by
        ignoring the strengths inherent in the American cultural contribution
        of participatory government?
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the ManKind project stresses individual responsibility,
        teaching each man to ask for what he wants and needs. Two years into a
        pandemic, those who want vaccinations have gotten them. Others are
        aware of risks they might take in attending gatherings where close
        contact is likely. With due respect for the intentions of MKPUSA in
        ensuring strict Covid safety, further blanket restrictions on the NWTA
        will be increasingly counterproductive, causing MKPUSA to fail in its
        relevance, its mission, and its financial viability as an
        organization.
      </p>

      <h2>The Invitation</h2>

      <p>In light of all of the above, we call on MKPUSA to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Come into accountability with written representations made, during
          unification, that the NWTA would remain under local area control,
        </li>
        <li>
          Actively facilitate men’s work in general (and the NWTA in
          particular) instead of standing in its way<a id="f3-inline" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Seek representative input from constituent areas and accord them a
          voice in MKPUSA governance, and
        </li>
        <li>
          Publish MKPUSA’s formulation of Covid risk. If <em>specific</em> legal advice
          or insurance requirements continue to prevent the NWTA from
          happening, publish the documents and give men the opportunity to
          understand why.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Initiation has been called the birthright of men. Many men are willing
        to take risks to do their work. The time is now.<a id="f4-inline" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a>
        The world is (still) on fire, and…
      </p>

      <p>Men are waiting.</p>

          effect has been to eliminate them entirely.

          separate corporations, separate bank accounts, and separate
          governance. In the lead up to 2015, MKPUSA proposed unification
          under a centralized corporate structure to streamline administrative
          functions, promising that events would remain under local control.

          <a href="#f3-inline"><sup>3</sup></a> With regard to “other events,”
          MKPUSA could have successfully managed risk by keeping its previous
          policy, which required this disclaimer about events promoted through
          MKP channels: “The following is being forwarded to you by the
          ManKind Project USA as a service to you and to the sender. The
          ManKind Project USA does not create or produce this program.”
          Instead, four days later, the policy was modified by MKP USA
          Training and Event Safety to read as follows: “If it’s an event that
          a reasonable person would assume is an MKP USA event, and MKP USA
          has not cleared it for sponsoring, it may not be produced, managed,
          administered, or promoted by MKP volunteers or role-holders.
          Non-sponsored events may not be promoted through any MKP USA email
          list or web site.” Thus MKPUSA refused to acknowledge
          Intermountain’s proposal or collaborate to produce an NWTA for which
          there was an innovative plan and significant energy <em>in favor of</em>
          expanding restrictions even to the point that it tried to articulate
          what its volunteers could or could not to. This creates the distinct
          impression that MKPUSA has been more focused on what <em>cannot</em> happen
          and why rather than on what <em>can</em> happen and how.

          the local areas that comprise them. MKPUSA can trust local men and
          leaders to make reasoned decisions for the health and safety of
          participants, and it is past time for MKPUSA to honor its stated
          representations made prior to and during unification.
