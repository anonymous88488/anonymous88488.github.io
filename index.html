      <p>My warrior brothers, nearly two weeks ago I was blessed by my community to become Intermountain’s new area steward. As honored as I am by that trust, I need to explain why I feel called instead to leave the ManKind Project—specifically our national organization.</p>
      <p>I initiated in Chicago in December of 2009 when my life was falling apart. The healing and brotherhood I found was exactly what I needed. My involvement in the ManKind Project saved my life.</p>
      <p>I resolved to give back. I started on the leader path. I sat in I-groups and helped develop them. I found new locations for Intermountain NWTAs, serving as weekend coordinator. I served on the Mental Health Resource Team to help ready men for the NWTA. And most importantly, I led my own son and 51 other men to the weekend to start their journeys. Those 51 men have in turn led 23 others to the work.</p>
      <p>Of the men I led to the weekend, four didn’t complete their journeys. One man I will call “Kent.” He had registered but wasn’t allowed on the weekend because his medical form was late. Within two weeks, Kent took his life. He can no longer do his work, but I want to leave you my blessing so other men can do theirs. With that in mind…</p>
      <p>I bless the Project, and specifically MKPUSA, to overcome fear sufficiently to pursue every possible opportunity for men’s work. In 2021, when public events started to resume, Intermountain proposed a vaccinated-only NWTA. It wasn’t perfect, but it was something. MKPUSA acknowledged our proposal but never issued a reply. It seemed that fear was causing MKPUSA to focus more on why men’s work couldn’t happen than on how it could. After our weekend was cancelled, MKPUSA did start to allow vaccinated-only weekends.</p>
      <p>Why does it matter? On every NWTA we look at “What’s at Risk?” We ask each man to weigh the risk of action against the risks of not acting to get what he wants. It is true that Covid could be spread at an NWTA, and this will likely be true for years. But the NWTA also saves lives. It saved mine. It might have saved Kent’s. How many other lives, homes, and relationships could we be saving? If we say the “world is on fire,” let’s act like it is.</p>
      <p>I bless MKPUSA to trust men to take responsibility for their health, their lives, and their communities. Is there ongoing concern about the pandemic? Yes. And at this point, men who wish to be vaccinated have done so. Other men understand the risks of gathering. The world has largely moved on from pandemic restrictions. In the words of one certified man, “70,000 people attended the Super Bowl in LA. MKP can’t decide to have 40 good men meet outdoors. They are frozen in fear.” The time is now for MKPUSA to move on from this pandemic of fear and trust men to take responsibility for themselves.</p>
      <p>Why does it matter? The “men on the ground”—those who do the work of planning and coordinating NWTAs just won’t do so when they know MKPUSA can cancel it without input or communication with the local area. This has happened in Intermountain twice. I speak from experience here, as I was on point both times. I speak for myself, but I think other men will also be unwilling to coordinate weekends when the same thing could happen to them.</p>
      <p>I bless MKPUSA to think expansively and creatively about cultural appropriation. One of the things I loved most about my initiation was the experience of Native traditions and cultures. We must not appropriate culture, but nor do I believe we can build bridges of understanding without experiencing the richness of other cultures. Are we asking our Native brothers to share parts of their culture with us so we can honor and understand it?</p>
      <p>Why does it matter? When corrections of cultural appropriation are boiled down to lists of “don’ts,” they tend to generate resentment and may work against building bridges with other cultures and traditions. No work involving matters of culture and diversity will change this core truth, that: I cannot learn to love another culture by retreating into my own.</p>
      <p>Through a travel network I participate in, I have been privileged to host hundreds of people in my home from six continents. I’ve eaten with them, traveled with them, prayed with them, laughed with them, and cried with them. I am a richer man for it. And I am gratified that almost every time I’ve asked, others have been willing to share their culture and heritage with me when I have asked seeking to honor and understand.</p>
      <p>I bless MKPUSA to make space for the cultures that comprise it. Too often I’ve heard that our national organization wants to standardize the NWTA to create a uniform product. Think about that for a moment. In the United States, nearly every time there has been a push for everything to be “the same,” culture has been marginalized or erased. You may recall a program called the “Indian Placement Program,” whereby Native American youth were placed in Caucasian homes to help them “assimilate into majority-American culture.” The paradigm at the time was the “melting pot,” by which the unique heritage, traditions, language, beliefs, rituals, and other symbols—the essence of their culture—was to be “melted away” into White culture.</p>
      <p>Several years ago, according to a firsthand account, Hawaii had made a request of MKPUSA to change certain elements of the NWTA to better meet the needs of local culture. Not only were those requests denied, but MKPUSA moved to disband the Hawaii Council and Leader Body.</p>
      <p>I and many other men here in Intermountain grew up with shame-based sexuality infused by a dominant religious tradition. On the NWTA, when a man is called to step into a dress code we call “warrior formal,” he is also empowered to step out of shame and self-loathing in a meaningful way. For me, doing so was transformational. And the proposed elimination of this tradition (among others) causes me to wonder if MKPUSA sees and values cultural differences within. Is it realistic for MKPUSA to think it can lead the way in teaching respect for culture while erasing the traditions of individual communities that comprise it?</p>
      <p>I bless the certified men of the Project to find their voice and to stand in the energy of the King to effect positive change. I have heard from many certified men bemoaning how stewardship of the Project overall and NWTAs in particular has passed from certified men to others with lesser experience or corporate agendas. I have heard certified men complain about the functional paralysis of the national organization. I have yet to hear them unite their voices to create a shared vision of what is possible and make it happen.</p>
      <p>Finally, I bless MKPUSA to honor its agreements. Prior to unification, Intermountain was promised, in writing, that “Our ability to decide when and where we hold NWTAs and other MKP related trainings… will not change.” This representation formed a basis of our vote to unify. The pandemic may have necessitated temporary adjustments, but it did not renegotiate agreements.</p>
      <p>In attempting to address my concerns, one man said to me, “Russ, you just need to trust that really smart men are making these changes—men with years of experience and the best of intentions.” What I know is that trust naturally flows from being in integrity with agreements and core principles. There is no substitute.</p>
      <p>I grew up in small-town Idaho where my family raised livestock. A basic lesson from my youth is that when they are not fed or secured, animals will seek nourishment in greener pastures. While MKPUSA has been paralyzed by the pandemic, its workhorses have been migrating to other organizations and trainings so they can continue their work to serve, heal, and connect.</p>
      <p>For the past two years I tried to engage our national organization. Nothing worked. Most recently I had an idea to gather with some Intermountain leaders, draw upon some “wild man” energy, and “rattle the cages” of inaction. That also didn’t go as planned. I am left with some wise words from my mentor: “Russ,” he said, “sometimes you have to let go of your attachment to a specific outcome to see what’s next.” Next to the births of my five children, many of my most powerful moments have been with men on the mountain. Now it’s time for me to see what’s next.</p>
      <p>So, in parting, I bless MKPUSA and the men who lead it:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>to overcome fear sufficiently to pursue every possible opportunity for men’s work,</li>
         <li>to trust men to take responsibility for themselves,</li>
         <li>to think expansively and creatively about cultural appropriation,</li>
         <li>to make space for the individual cultures within our ranks, and finally,</li>
         <li>I bless MKPUSA to honor its agreements.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I also bless the certified men of the Project to stand together, find their voices, and lead.</p>
      <p>Thank you for what you do and for who you are—for making a difference to me. I go with a clear sense of mission, resolved to carry that mission with greater clarity and purpose to those I serve. May you resolve to rekindle the fires of initiation and light the way so that others may see and do their work.</p>
